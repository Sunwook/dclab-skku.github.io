My research is focussed on the role of the gut microbiota in colorectal cancer (CRC). Numerous studies have identified shifts in the microbiota of CRC patients compared to healthy individuals. Using mouse a model of CRC, we've studied how such shifts can influence the progression of tumorigenesis. Now I'm working to develop microbiota-based models for identifying patients with CRC and to complement conventional non-invasive tests (i.e. fecal occult blood test, fecal immunochemical test) for improved detection of pre-cancerous lesions. Ultimately we hope to be capable of assessing an individual's risk for developing CRC based on their microbiota and other risk factors. With a better understanding of the microbiota's role in tumorigenesis, we could design pre- and probiotic therapies to prevent or slow the development of CRC.
