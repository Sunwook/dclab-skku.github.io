Joanna returned to the Schloss lab in 2023 as a Bioinformaticist, having previously been an undergraduate researcher in 2019, working with Sarah Tomkovich on *Clostridium difficile*.
During her MS, Joanna worked on characterizing the plant microbiome of plant compartments in the common bean with Dr. Ashley Shade, as well as designing a protocol for creating your own "Mock Microbial Community" for seqeuencing and extraction applications. 
After her MS, Joanna completed a CDC Infectious Disease fellowship at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, where she aided the lab in building sequencing capacity.
