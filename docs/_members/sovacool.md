I'm interested in developing bioinformatics tools, packages, and data analysis 
pipelines for microbial ecology and host-associated microbiome research. 
I'm a fan of open science, open source software, and reproducible research.

When I'm not in the dry lab, you might find me running, cycling, climbing, or 
otherwise being active outside. 
I also volunteer with [Girls Who Code](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/), 
teach [Software Carpentry](https://umcarpentries.github.io/) workshops, 
and host [CoderSpaces](https://datascience.isr.umich.edu/events/coderspaces/) office hours.
