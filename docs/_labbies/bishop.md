As lab manager, I handle most sequencing related lab work and day-to-day operations of the Schloss lab. My duties include: assisting grad students/post docs with bench work, supply procurement and coordination with external vendors, general lab maintenance, and keeping the lab in compliance with university, state, and federal guidelines.
