Within the Schloss lab, I am primarily responsible for supporting day-to-day operations. I help the graduate students and post-docs carry out experiments and generate data, keep the lab space and equipment maintained, and assist with organizing and management of the large amounts of data the lab produces. Previously, I worked on exploring the microbial communities Superfund sites; and now I am learning a lot about the human gut microbiome and how it contributes to various diseases!
