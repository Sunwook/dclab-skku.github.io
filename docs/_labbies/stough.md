During my Master's and PhD work, I trained amongst microbial ecologists in a broad variety of different environmental ecosystems. As such I have focused less on building expertise in an individual system, and more on developing my own unique approaches to analyzing large sequencing datasets in order to address fundamental ecological questions and propose novel hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. I am interested in the diversity and function of viruses, as well as their contribution the structure and function of microbial communities. I will be working in the Schloss lab to explore some of these ideas as they relate to recurrent *Clostridium difficile* infection.
