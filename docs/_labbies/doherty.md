I'm a wet lab microbiologist learning computational microbiology while working to determine the effects of a novel Crohn's disease therapy on the fecal microbiome. I am also trying to determine whether the fecal microbiome of these patients can be used as a biomarker to predict response to treatment. Previously I've researched antimicrobial resistance and novel therapies for HIV and MRSA.
