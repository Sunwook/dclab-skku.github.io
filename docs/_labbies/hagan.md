Until joining the Schloss lab, my undergradate through doctoral research focused on bacterial iron acquisition. During growth in iron-limited conditions, bacteria synthesize and export small molecules called siderophores that scavenge iron from the environment to enhance growth and enable infections. In my doctorate work, I identified how the _Bacillus anthracis_ siderophore petrobactin is exported as well as an alternate role for petrobactin in _B. anthracis_ sporulation. In the Schloss lab, I am funded by a fellowship with the American Society for Microbiology to study gender representation in the publishing ecosystem. I also have a background in science communication and am a Senior Contributor to the [ASM Microbial Sciences blog](https://www.asm.org/index.php/general-science-blog).
