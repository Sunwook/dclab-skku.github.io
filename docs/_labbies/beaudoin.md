I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Microbiology, paired with a minor in Polymer Chemistry. I am interested in the interactions between species in the gut microbiome, specifically focusing on the production and secretion of bacteriocins and other secondary metabolites and their relevance to *C. difficile* infections.
