I'm currently Dr. Schloss' lab technician/psuedo-manager.  I handle the day-to-day operations for us.  Amongst my responsibilities are: assisting grad students/post docs with mouse and bench work, supply procurement, general lab maintenance, and equipment upkeep/maintenance. In addition, I handle the lab's compliance with university, state, and federal guidelines.  Most of my time, however, is spent on miscellaneous side (Pat) projects.  These are often sequencing related collaborations with individuals, labs, and companies from all over the country.
