I am a microbiologist with a passion for combining molecular and computational techniques to understand the ecology of the human microbiome and virome, and how they impact health and disease. The long-term goal of my research is to positively impact the medical field by characterizing the complex ecology of human bacterial and viral communities, and to translate those findings into clinical applications. I foresee the most immediately tractable translational applications being phage therapy, optimized probiotic therapies, and prognostic (predictive) modeling. In the long term, this field has a strong translational future and my goal is to help shape that future.
