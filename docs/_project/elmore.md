My research project focuses on the strain-level genomic variation of *Fusobacterium nucleatum* *in vivo*. We are interested in why *F. nucleatum*, a bacterium enriched in colorectal cancer, is abundant in the mouth but rarely colonizes the gut. I am developing bioinformatic methods using metagenomic data to characterize genetic variation and identify genes that allow *F. nucleatum* to colonize the gut. This research will be important towards understanding the microbial ecology of *F. nucleatum* and it's role in CRC.

Shortly after I joined the lab in 2014, I was invited to train at the USRowing Olympic training center to compete for a spot on the 2016 Olympic team. Pat has been amazingly supportive of my journey as I've worked part-time towards my degree while training!
