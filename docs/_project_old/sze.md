I previously spent a lot of time during my PhD investigating the lung bacterial microbiome and its role in the disease known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. I recently moved from the temperate westcoast to the University of Michigan.  You might be asking, why? Well, I could not resist the opportunity to be mentored by Pat and to study the bacterial microbiome of families. My interests in the microbiome are mostly involved with how the human host interacts with the bacterial community, how this interaction could potentially cause or exacerbate disease, and how both these interactions contribute to helping to shape either the host cellular community or the bacterial microbiome.
