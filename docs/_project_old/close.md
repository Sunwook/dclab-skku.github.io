For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in studying viruses. While my Ph.D. work sought to identify how human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a herpesvirus, exits host cells, my passion has always been bacteriophage.  With the burgeoning field of virome research, I saw my opening and jumped at the opportunity to work with Pat to look at the how viruses interact and influence the microbiome leading to disease. As a model for these interactions, my research in Pat's lab specifically focuses on understanding the ways viruses promote susceptibility or resistance to Clostridium difficile infection by altering the gastrointestinal microbiome. We hope to use information gleaned from these studies to demonstrate the importance of viral population dynamics in maintaining human health.
