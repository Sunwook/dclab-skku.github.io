My graduate work characterized the microbial communities associated with the respiratory tract of individuals with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). I identified anaerobic bacterial communities associated with CRS that collectively degraded mucin glycoproteins, and demonstrated that mucin degradation by these communities can impact the physiology of _Staphylococcus aureus_. As a postdoc in Pat's lab, I am currently applying my passion for anaerobic bacteria and metabolism to the study of microbial communities in the human intestinal tract.
