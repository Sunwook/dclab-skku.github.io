Our weekly lab meetings generally meet for two hours. After 15 min of set up and
announcements we have two presentations that are led by separate individuals.
Each week we rotate around the lab and will cover two of four different formats:

* **Research talk:** An update of your current research progress in the lab.
This should involved slides. Please send slides to research group by Monday
morning so people can have a chance to review what you will be talking about.
* **Journal club:** Discussion of a paper that you find worth reading. To cut
down on the problem of crappy papers, read the paper before you pick it out.
Send paper to group by the end of the Friday before journal club.
* **Chalk talk:** No slides. Present an idea for a future research project.
This should include an observation, hypothesis, predictions, and discussion of
several specific aims.
* **Code review:** Select a chunk of code (~50 lines) that you either want to
share with the lab, want help with, or that you have recently written. This may
also involve some type of demo of a package you have recently discovered and
want to share.
