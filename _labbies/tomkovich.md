Previously, my research focused on the impact of the microbiome on host immune responses during homeostasis in zebrafish and the role of the microbiome in colorectal cancer development using mouse models. Iâ€™m interested in how the host and microbiome respond to environmental factors such as medications or diets and how these perturbations contribute to *Clostridium difficile* infections and colorectal cancer development.
