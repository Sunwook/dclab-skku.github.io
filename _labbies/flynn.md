My research is broadly focused on the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer. It is well-established that perturbances in gut microbial communities can promote tumorigenesis in the colon. My two main projects focus on both on a specific member of the tumor microbial community (Fusobacterium nucleatum) as well as examining the community as a whole spatially in the colon. For the latter project, I've teamed up with a gastroenterologist at UM and we are conducting a translational research project examining colonic mucosa microbial communities of the right and left colon. I'm excited by the power of sequencing technologies and bioinformatic tools to probe the microbial ecology of human health and disease.
